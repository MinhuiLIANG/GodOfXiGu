                    Minhui hails from <span style="color: rgb(105, 142, 106);">Lanzhou City, Gansu Province</span> in northwestern <span style="color: rgb(105, 142, 106);">mainland China</span>, and has spent all of his pre-teen years there. 
                    Among them, he considers the three years he spent at <span style="color: rgb(105, 142, 106);">The High School Attached to Northwest Normal University</span> to be his happiest time and the time he grew to love learning.
                    <p>
                    When he first started college, his grades were not outstanding and, he was not sure of the direction of his future career and aspirations. In the summer after his freshman year,
                    he participated in his first research activity, but due to his lack of knowledge and experience, he did not produce good results and was discouraged, frustrated and confused.
                    <p>
                    Fortunately, Minhui got into the highly competitive <span style="color: rgb(105, 142, 106);">automation program</span> by staying close to the minimum admission line. There, he met many diligent and gifted students, 
                    and Minhui actively asked them for advice, not only on knowledge and technical confusion, but also on the study methods of these outstanding students, and gradually, 
                    Minhui's grades improved and he felt enriched inside.
                    <p>
                    Thanks to the advice of his best friend, Minhui rejoined a major research competition, <span style="color: rgb(105, 142, 106);">the College Students' Innovative Entrepreneurial Training Plan Program</span>, as a zero-basic participant.
                    Minhui's project was to build <span style="color: rgb(105, 142, 106);">software for diagnosing cardiovascular disease</span>. Needless to say, it was a very difficult process, as Minhui and his team learned from scratch, 
                    repeatedly discussed their research plan, and painstakingly wrote code and designed and implemented algorithms and software step by step. They often met at 1 a.m. to code, 
                    and often ate only one meal a day. To make matters worse, Minhui's knee ligaments and meniscus were severely damaged during a sporting event, resulting in Minhui having to undergo 
                    surgery before exams and spending the semester in a wheelchair and bed. It is worth mentioning that during the hospitalization, Minhui was still coding in the bed before the surgery, 
                    but after the surgery Minhui had trouble getting up. Thinking back, Minhui is grateful for the support and cooperation of his team, and ultimately they were successful in winning the award.
                    <p>
                    Minhui considers himself to be a modest person. Minhui is not a very gifted person, but he hopes to make himself knowledgeable and specialized by accumulating knowledge. 
                    Minhui is not a very brave person, but he hopes to persevere to the best of his ability when he encounters difficulties. Minhui aspires to a good character summed up in four words: <span style="color: rgb(105, 142, 106);">diligence</span>, <span style="color: rgb(105, 142, 106);">prudence</span>, <span style="color: rgb(105, 142, 106);">sincerity</span>, and <span style="color: rgb(105, 142, 106);">courage</span>.
